This contains the code from Jiang et al (2020), in package form so it is
easier for me to compare in simulations.

To see the original repo, go to
<https://github.com/LiboJiang/DoubleReduction>

The main functions are

-   `main_p2()`: Calculate maximum likelihood esimates of double
    reduction and allele frequency in tetraploids using *all* genotypes.
-   `main_p3()`: Calculate maximum likelihood esimates of double
    reduction and allele frequency in tetraploids using *just*
    heterozygous/homozygous.
-   `sim_p()`: Simulate genotypes at equilibrium in tetraploids.
-   `sim_p3()`: Simulate heterozygous/homozygous at equilibrium in
    tetraploids.
