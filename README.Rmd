This contains the code from Jiang et al (2021), in package form so it 
is easier for me to compare in simulations.

To see the original repo, go to <https://github.com/LiboJiang/DoubleReduction>

The main functions are

- `main_multi()`: Fit `main_p2()` across many loci.
- `main_p2()`: Calculate maximum likelihood esimates of double reduction
    and allele frequency in tetraploids using *all* genotypes.
- `main_p3()`: Calculate maximum likelihood esimates of double reduction
    and allele frequency in tetraploids using *just* heterozygous/homozygous.
- `sim_p()`: Simulate genotypes at equilibrium in tetraploids.
- `sim_p3()`: Simulate heterozygous/homozygous at equilibrium in tetraploids.
